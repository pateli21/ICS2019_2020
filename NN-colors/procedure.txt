\f0\fs24 \cf0 Procedure:\
The language used is Python version 3.7.3. The libraries numpy, sci-kit, pandas, matplotlib.pyplot, and seaborn were also installed.\
The data was collected from the website coolors.co. Random colors were generated with the website and information such as RGB, CMYK, hue, brightness, was also provided for each of the colors.\
There were four parameters set and three possible outcomes. The different cyan, magenta, yellow, and key values of each color were the parameters. The three outcomes were red, green, or blue depending on the highest value of the three RGB values of the color. The inner layers were set to two and three layers respectively. \
The data was shuffled and trained. Then another set of untrained data was tested. After testing the data was cross-validated as well. \
